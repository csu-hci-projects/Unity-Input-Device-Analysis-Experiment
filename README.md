## Progress Up To Date (Updated with each Pull Request)

So far, this project includes code and executable for the Shooting Input Device Experiment. This code can be ran be executing the "Project/Shooting_Experiment/Executables/Input Device Experiment.exe". Before running this executable, make sure to have downloaded the contents of the *entire* Executables directory. Otherwise the executable will not work. Also, make sure to have the input device you plan to use for the experiment plugged in before clicking the executable. Meaning, if you wanted to use a mouse, make sure it is plugged in before you run the .exe file. The same goes for trackball mouse and gamepad. Also, if using a gamepad, the cursor will not move in the UI. Instead follow the instructions shown on screen. If using a PS4 remote A button = X button and B button = Square button.

Once the final tweaks are made to the Shooting Experiment, I will create the drawing experiment, then the maneuvering experiment. Luckily, much of the code used for the Shooting Experiment can be reused in the aforementioned experiments, so I expect progress to be much quicker for these endeavors.
